# Terra-Bank-Loan
This project analyzed loans disbursed by Terra Bank to uncover key trends and insights related to customer demographics, loan demand, and repayment behaviors

# KEY INSIGHTS
1. In 2011, the highest loan amount of $206,506,575 was disbursed, while the lowest loan amount of $2,219,275 was issued in the year 200. This explains why 2011 had the highest number of debtors 
(21,656), compared to only 21 in 200.
2.  Grade G loans received the highest interest rate of 21.40%, while Grade A loans had the lowest at 7.34%.
3. Canada recorded the highest total loan amount of $80 million and also had the largest number of debtors, totaling 7,099.
4. Grade B received the highest loan amount of $134 million, whereas Grade G had the lowest, with only $6 million disbursed, which may be attributed to its high interest rate of 21.40%. The high cost of borrowing could have discouraged applicants, while lenders may have also restricted loan amounts due to higher default risks.
5. Loans with a 60-month term had a higher average interest rate (14.81%) compared to 36-month loans, which had a lower rate of 11%.
6. A total of 32,950 debtors fully repaid their loans, 5,627 loans were charged off, and 1,140 remain in current status.
7. Among all debtors, 16,921 loans were verified, 12,809 were not verified, and 9,987 were source-verified.
 
# RECOMMENDATIONS
1.)Insight: In 2011, the highest loan amount of $206,506,575 was disbursed, while the lowest of $2,219,275 was issued in 200. This explains why 2011 had the highest number of debtors (21,656), 
compared to only 21 in 2007.
Recommendation: Analyze what factors led to the high loan disbursement in 2011 (e.g., economic policies, lower interest rates, or increased lender confidence). If favorable, consider replicating 
those strategies to boost lending in future years.

2.)Insight: Grade G loans received the highest interest rate of 21.40%, while Grade A loans had the lowest at 7.34%.
 -Recommendation: Consider adjusting interest rates for Grade G to make loans more attractive while balancing risk. Offering incentives like collateral-backed loans or gradual rate reductions for 
on-time payments may help increase borrowing.

3.)Insight: Canada recorded the highest total loan amount of $80 million and also had the largest number of debtors, totaling 7,099.
-Recommendation: Investigate what made Canada a top-performing regionâ€”whether due to favorable loan policies, economic conditions, or borrower creditworthiness. If possible, apply similar 
strategies in lower-performing regions.

4.)Insight: Grade B received the highest loan amount of $134 million, whereas Grade G had the lowest, with only $6 million disbursed.
-Recommendation: Assess why Grade B is preferred and use similar risk assessment models for lower grades. Offering customized repayment plans for Grade G borrowers may encourage more 
lending while managing risk.

5.)Insight: Loans with a 60-month term had a higher average interest rate (14.81%) compared to 36-month loans, which had a lower rate of 11%.
 Recommendation: To encourage longer-term borrowing, consider reducing interest rates slightly for 60-month loans or offering incentives like lower monthly payments to make them more 
attractive.

6.)Insight: A total of 32,950 debtors fully repaid their loans, 5,627 loans were charged off, and 1,140 remain in current status.
Recommendation: Identify patterns in charged-off loans (e.g., borrower profiles, loan terms) and implement stronger risk assessment or early intervention strategies (e.g., automated payment 
reminders, restructuring options) to reduce defaults.

7.)  Insight: Among all debtors, 16,921 loans were verified, 12,809 were not verified, and 9,987 were source-verified.
-Recommendation: Strengthen the verification process to reduce the number of unverified loans, which could pose higher risks. Encouraging source verification may improve lender confidence 
and reduce default rates
